Please note that our proposal handling system has recently been updated
to allow you to save your review as a draft prior to completing it.
When you are happy with your review,
please check the "review complete" box at the end of the review
form and save it to mark it as finished.

You have been identified as an expert in your field,
so you may have some acquaintance or previous
involvement with the applicants.
At a certain level this should not disqualify you
from providing your opinion.

You need not make any assessment of the technical feasibility of the
proposal - that is being done by JCMT staff: it is the merit of
the scientific case which we request you assess.

On behalf of the JCMT Time Allocation Committee,
we thank you in advance for your
participation in the proposal review process.
