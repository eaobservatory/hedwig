Please be aware that, to maximize productivity,
{{ facility_definite_name }} uses flexible scheduling
whereby observing programs are matched to
available instrumentation, weather conditions and
priority as assigned
{{ 'in the peer review process' if is_peer_review else 'by the Time Allocation Committee' }}.
Therefore we are not able to guarantee that all of the
time listed above will be available for your project.
