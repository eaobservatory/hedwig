Creating a Proposal
===================

On the main home page you will find a large tile for each facility
showing an image of the facility its name.
Clicking on this tile will take you to the facility home page.

At the top of the facility home page you will find a list
of all the semesters for which there are open calls for proposals.

Clicking on the semester in the list will take you to a page
showing information about the call for proposals for that
semester.

On this page you will find:

* A summary of important dates:

  * The dates of the semester --- this
    indicates when observing time is available.

  * The closing date for the call for proposals.  There may be
    multiple queues available, possibly with different closing dates.

* Information about the call for proposals.

* A list of the queues which are available, showing:

  * Information about the queue.

  * The opening and closing dates of the call for the queue.

For each queue there is a link which you can use to start a new
proposal for that queue.

Once you have selected a queue, you will see the "New Proposal" page.
Please check that the fixed information presented on the page is correct
before proceeding.
This information comprises the facility, semester and queue for which
you are creating a proposal and your name.

Each queue will have a list of applicable affiliations.
You should select the affiliation which applies to you personally.
If you are unsure which to choose, please check for more information
on the call for proposals page.

Finally enter the title of your proposal.  You will be able to
edit the title again before submitting the proposal, but you will
need to choose a title now to allow you to find the proposal
in the system if you wish to return to it later.

When you're ready, press the "Create new proposal" button.

On the next page you will see your new, blank, proposal
ready for you to start working on.

Please note the following features of the page:

* In the menu at the top of the page there is a link to
  "Your proposals".
  This lists all the proposals of which you are a
  member.  If you leave your proposal and wish to return
  to it later, you will be able to access it via your proposal list.

* A proposal identifier will be shown.
  If you need to contact us regarding your proposal, please
  give this identifier to help us find it.

* The proposal state is listed as "In preparation" and there is
  a link labeled "Submit proposal".
  In this state your proposal has not been submitted.
  Be sure to submit your proposal before the closing date
  for it to be considered, but you will need to complete more
  of the proposal before you can do so.

Also note the red and yellow boxes on your proposal:

* **Red boxes** indicate warnings about your proposal.
  Initially you will see a red box indicating that the proposal
  has not yet been submitted.

* **Yellow boxes** indicate sections of the proposal where something
  is missing.
  As you complete the various sections of the proposals,
  the yellow boxes will stop being shown.
  In some cases you may not be able to complete all the missing
  sections, for example in a target of opportunity proposal
  where you do not know the targets in advance,
  or your first proposal for the facility where you won't have
  any previous proposals to list.
