Submitting your Proposal
========================

When your proposal is ready to submit,
use the "Submit proposal" link near the top of the
proposal page to start the process.

A basic validation will be performed to check for missing
sections of the proposal.
This can produce two kinds of messages:

Errors
    These prevent the submission of the proposal.

Warnings
    You may submit the proposal if it has only warnings but no errors.

After any error or warning message there will normally be a link
to help you address the problem.
In some cases you may not be able to resolve all of the warnings,
for example if you have no previous proposals to list.

If there are no errors, you will be able to submit your proposal.

Note that the lack of errors and warnings should not be taken
as an indication that everything is in order.
You should still check that the proposal is complete and that
you have included any information requested in the call for proposals
or in the notes on the technical and scientific justification
editing pages.

When a proposal is submitted, the members of the proposal will
receive a notification by email.
The email will go to each member's primary email address
but that address will only be shown in the "To" header of
the email if it is marked as public.
If the person's email address is private
(which is the default setting)
then they will receive the email by BCC
rather than appearing in the "To" header.

After submitting your proposal you will still be able to edit it
up until the closing date of the call for proposals.
If you do make changes after submission, you do not have to resubmit
your proposal. Instead any changes you make after submitting are
automatically included. However, please note that other members of the
proposal will not be automatically notified about these changes.
If you wish to perform another validation while the
proposal is in the "Submitted" state,
use the "Validate proposal" link near the top of the proposal page.

Finally, should you wish to withdraw a submitted proposal,
use the "Withdraw proposal" link near the top of the proposal page.
As mentioned above, however, withdrawing is not necessary
if you would like to continue editing the proposal.
In particular it is recommended that you do not withdraw
close to the closing date with the intention of re-submitting
in case something goes wrong at the last minute and you
aren't able to do so.

When you withdraw a proposal, an email will be sent to all
members of the proposal to inform them of the change.
