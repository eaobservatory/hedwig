Final Review Phase
==================

The final review phase is the part of the review process where
:doc:`decisions are entered <tabulation_decision>` and
:doc:`feedback is written and sent <feedback>`.

Once the main review part of the review process is complete and you
are ready to start making decisions, you can use the
"Advance to final review phase" link on the review process page.
In the final review phase, some types of reviews will
no longer be editable.
The confirmation page lists these roles and shows
the deadline for each, if one was set.
This allows you to check that you will not be closing access
to reviews for which the deadline has not yet passed.
