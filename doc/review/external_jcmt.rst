JCMT External Review Guidelines
===============================

Background
----------

Applications for observing time on JCMT are assessed by the
JCMT Time Allocation Committee (TAC),
which is composed of astronomers from each of the partner
regions who are the professional peers of the applicants.
Their assessments rely upon the opinions of expert referees
on the scientific merit of the proposals.

Technical feasibility is assessed separately by JCMT personnel.

Completing the Review
---------------------

After :doc:`accepting your invitation <invitation>`
or from :doc:`your review list <review_list>`
you can view the proposal and :doc:`edit your review <external>`.
You may 'Save' your report at any time, and any number of times.
You might want to consider the following aspects of the proposal
in making your assessment of its suitability:

Scientific justification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* How do you rate the scientific aims of the proposal?
* Are there conflicting / confusing goals?
* Have the potential difficulties been raised and discussed?

Where would you place this proposal within the following scale?

*  Extremely thorough and compelling.
*  Convincing and well described.
*  Adequate, with minor problems.
*  Inadequate (too brief, confusing, incomplete or incorrect).

The plan for observing and data reduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Are the details of the program dealt with / understood?
* Are the target objects, coordinates and instrumentation correct?
* Is the telescope requested the correct one?

Where would you place this proposal within the following scale?

*  Thorough and clearly understood.
*  Correct and well described.
*  Adequate, with minor problems.
*  Inadequately described or poorly understood.

Urgency of the proposed observations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where would you place this proposal within the following scale?

*  Timely and competitive: must be done now.
*  Should be done now.
*  Urgency is not a major consideration.

The bulk of your report is intended to be free-format, but
it would be helpful to address the above issues in some order.
In addition, if you feel this application is not, as it stands,
of the highest scientific quality, please suggest how it
might be improved in future submissions.
You might also wish to comment on the applicants' competence to carry
out the proposed project to a successful conclusion.
Please mark any comments which you feel should be
communicated back to the applicant(s).
One of the TAC assessors will make that contact.

There is no need to attempt an independent assessment of the technical
feasibility of the proposal: observatory personnel will check whether
the requested integration time is correct, whether the telescope
and instrument will perform the observations as requested, etc.
Any such comments, however, perhaps from your own previous experience,
will be welcomed.

In addition, there is one box on the form to complete:

"Rating"
~~~~~~~~

Please give this proposal a numerical rating on the following scale:

+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 100 | A clear proposal with potentially seminal results.                    |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 75  | A potentially seminal project that has perhaps not been clearly       |
|     | explained or has minor flaws.                                         |
|     | Rating is given for potential for good science.                       |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 50  | A solid proposal which ought to get time --- depending on             |
|     | competition for RA/Dec and time left after allocating                 |
|     | higher ranked proposals.                                              |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 25  | A proposal with some flaw.                                            |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 0   | A proposal with serious flaws either in concept or design.            |
+-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Integer intermediate values (e.g. 87, 62, 37, 12) are also acceptable.

Other Considerations
--------------------

* The JCMT is heavily over-subscribed for periods of good weather
  (bands 1--2).
  Proposals that require such weather should have
  the potential for seminal results.

* Please do not approach the applicant(s) directly.
  Assessors will follow up on points requiring clarification.

Confidentiality
---------------

If you wish any of your comments to be copied to the applicants as part of
their feedback, please indicate which comments in your text.
Otherwise all of your comments will be considered confidential.
