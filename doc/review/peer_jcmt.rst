JCMT Peer Review Guidelines
===========================

Background
----------

While "Regular" and "Large Program" applications for observing time on JCMT
are assessed by the JCMT Time Allocation Committee (TAC),
"Rapid Turnaround" calls use a peer review process.
One member of each proposal is asked to review
several of the other proposals received at the same time.

Technical feasibility is assessed separately by JCMT personnel.
