JCMT Feedback Review Guidelines
===============================

Information
-----------

The feedback message which you enter will form part of an email
message which is sent to proposal members to inform them of
the outcome of the review process.
(It is also made available via the web interface once the
review process is complete.)

The system will automatically construct an introductory section
including the following information:

* Whether the proposal was accepted or rejected.

* A rough guide to the proposal's rating, such as the quartile
  within which it fell.

* The time allocation, if the proposal was accepted.

* A warning regarding flexible scheduling.

Here are a few guidelines to assist you in preparing your feedback
message:

* You do not need to repeat any of the information which is
  automatically inserted (such as the decision and time, as listed above).

* You may wish to avoid language which implies that the observing
  time is guaranteed, due to the nature of flexible scheduling.
  This is why the automatic part of the message refers to
  *"approved"* observing times, rather than time
  *"allocated"* or *"awarded"*.

Example Message - Acceptance
----------------------------

    We are glad to be able to inform you that your proposal M19AP001
    entitled "Example Proposal" was approved by the Time Allocation
    Committee.  Your proposal was rated in the
    highest quartile of those received for this call for proposals.

    The committee has approved the following observing times for your
    project:

    SCUBA-2, Band 1: 10.0 hours

    HARP, Band 3: 10.0 hours

    Please be aware that, to maximize productivity, the JCMT uses flexible
    scheduling whereby observing programs are matched to available
    instrumentation, weather conditions and priority as assigned by the
    Time Allocation Committee. Therefore we are not able to guarantee that
    all of the time listed above will be available for your project.

    The Time Allocation Committee made the following comments regarding
    your proposal:

    Observatory personnel will contact you shortly concerning the
